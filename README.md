### Git

#### The art of committing
 - Commit content
   - Break up every work into small tasks
   - Make only one change per commit
   - Include the whole change in one commit
   - Don't do partial commits
   - Isolate meaningless commits
 - Commit message
   - Describe the change (what the code does), not what you have done
   - Focus on the big picture
   - Every commit is a sentence in the repository history
   - Always start with a capital letter and finish with a dot
   - Use the imperative present tense (fix, add, implement) describing the change in a small subject sentence
   - Good examples:
     1. Send an email to the user with a link to renew the password.
     2. Add the newsletter signup in homepage.
   - Bad examples:
     1. Add the renew password reminder feature.
     2. Add the newsletter signup.
